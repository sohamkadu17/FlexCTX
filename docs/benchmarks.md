## Overview

Benchmark data is used to score model capabilities in three categories:
- **Reasoning**: Logic, math, analysis (MMLU, GPQA, Math)
- **Coding**: Programming ability (HumanEval, LiveCodeBench)
- **General**: Balanced overall performance

SmarterRouter can fetch data from multiple sources. Enable them via `ROUTER_BENCHMARK_SOURCES` in your `.env`:

```env
ROUTER_BENCHMARK_SOURCES=huggingface,lmsys,artificial_analysis
```

**Order matters:** Sources are queried sequentially. If multiple sources provide data for the same model, later sources overwrite earlier ones (last write wins). This lets you prioritize your preferred sources by ordering.

## HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard

**Source:** HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard dataset  
**What it provides:**
- MMLU (Multi-discipline Multi-choice Language Understanding)
- HellaSwag (commonsense reasoning)
- Winogrande (pronoun disambiguation)
- TruthfulQA (truthfulness)
- MMLU-Pro (harder version of MMLU)

**Coverage:** Broad coverage of open-weight models (Llama, Mistral, Mixtral, Qwen, Gemma, etc.)

**Update frequency:** Daily

**Configuration:** No API key required (public dataset)

**Pros:**
- Completely free, no rate limits
- Wide model coverage
- Standardized testing methodology

**Cons:**
- Limited to models that submit to leaderboard
- Doesn't include proprietary models (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Some benchmarks are older (may not reflect latest models)

**How it works:** SmarterRouter downloads the results from HuggingFace's datasets server and matches models using a combination of explicit mapping and fuzzy name matching.

---

## LMSYS Chatbot Arena

**Source:** LMSYS Chatbot Arena leaderboard  
**What it provides:**
- ELO ratings from crowd-sourced human voting
- MT-Bench scores (multi-turn conversation quality)
- Individual benchmark scores (GGP, math, etc.)

**Coverage:** Popular models including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and top open models

**Update frequency:** Weekly

**Configuration:** No API key required (public data)

**Pros:**
- Real-world user preference data
- Includes proprietary models
- ELO ratings reflect overall chat quality

**Cons:**
- Less granular than standardized benchmarks
- Human voting introduces noise
- Smaller model coverage than HuggingFace

**How it works:** Fetches the latest leaderboard data and merges with other sources.

---

## ArtificialAnalysis

**Source:** ArtificialAnalysis.ai independent evaluations  
**What it provides:**
- Proprietary **Intelligence Index** (0-100) - overall capability
- **Coding Index** (0-100) - programming proficiency
- **Math Index** (0-100) - mathematical reasoning
- Standard benchmarks: MMLU-Pro, GPQA, LiveCodeBench, Math-500
- Real-world **speed metrics**: tokens/sec, time-to-first-token
- **Pricing information** (for cloud APIs)
- Model metadata: creator, release date, context window

**Coverage:** Major cloud providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) and some open models

**Update frequency:** Daily

**Configuration:** Requires free API key (1,000 requests/day)

```env
# Get your key from https://artificialanalysis.ai/insights
ROUTER_ARTIFICIAL_ANALYSIS_API_KEY=your-key-here
ROUTER_ARTIFICIAL_ANALYSIS_CACHE_TTL=86400  # 24h cache (respect rate limits)
```

**Optional:** Model mapping file to handle naming differences (see `artificial_analysis_models.example.yaml`)

**Pros:**
- Comprehensive: benchmarks + speed + pricing in one source
- Proprietary indices provide alternative scoring
- Real-world throughput metrics help with speed-based routing
- Covers models other sources miss

**Cons:**
- API key required (free tier limited)
- Model naming may not match your local Ollama tags
- Smaller model coverage than HuggingFace

**How it works:**
1. Fetches all models from ArtificialAnalysis API
2. Maps AA model identifiers to your Ollama model names (using mapping file or auto-generation)
3. Converts AA scores to standard benchmark format
4. Stores AA-specific indices in `extra_data` column for future use
5. Speed metrics stored in `throughput` field

**Data mapping:**
- `artificial_analysis_intelligence_index` → stored in `extra_data` (0-100)
- `artificial_analysis_coding_index` → stored in `extra_data` (0-100)
- `artificial_analysis_math_index` → stored in `extra_data` (0-100)
- `mmlu_pro` → standard benchmark column `mmlu`
- `livecodebench` → standard benchmark column `humaneval` (coding proxy)
- `math_500` → standard benchmark column `math`
- `gpqa` → standard benchmark column `gpqa`
- `median_output_tokens_per_second` → standard benchmark column `throughput`

## Multi-Source Merging

When you enable multiple sources, SmarterRouter merges the data intelligently:

1. Each source fetches its data independently
2. Data is keyed by `ollama_name` (your Ollama model tag)
3. For each model, all non-null fields are collected
4. **Last source wins** for conflicting fields
5. Model's scored capability (`reasoning_score`, `coding_score`, `general_score`) are recalculated from the merged benchmark data

**Example:** With `ROUTER_BENCHMARK_SOURCES=huggingface,artificial_analysis`
- HuggingFace provides MMLU, HellaSwag, etc. for `llama3:70b`
- ArtificialAnalysis provides MMLU-Pro, LiveCodeBench, speed metrics for `openai/gpt-4o`
- Later source (AA) overwrites any overlapping fields (like `mmlu` if both provide it)
- Final benchmark row contains the best/merged data from both sources

**Best practice:** Order sources by priority:
```env
# Prefer HuggingFace for open models, but fill gaps with ArtificialAnalysis
ROUTER_BENCHMARK_SOURCES=huggingface,lmsys,artificial_analysis
```

Or prioritize ArtificialAnalysis for its speed data:
```env
ROUTER_BENCHMARK_SOURCES=huggingface,artificial_analysis
```

## Troubleshooting

### "ArtificialAnalysis provider returned 0 models"
- Check your API key is set correctly: `echo $ROUTER_ARTIFICIAL_ANALYSIS_API_KEY`
- Verify you haven't exceeded the 1,000 requests/day limit
- Check logs for mapping errors - your local model names may not match AA's naming
- Create a model mapping file to explicitly connect your models

### "No benchmark data for my model"
- Some models aren't in public leaderboards
- Use `ROUTER_ARTIFICIAL_ANALYSIS_MODEL_MAPPING_FILE` to map your model tag to an equivalent AA model
- Example: Your `llama3.1:70b` might map to AA's "Llama-3.1-70B"

### "Rate limit exceeded"
- Free tier is 1,000 requests/day
- Cache TTL defaults to 24h (86,400 seconds) to minimize re-fetching
- Increase cache TTL to reduce frequency: `ROUTER_ARTIFICIAL_ANALYSIS_CACHE_TTL=172800` (48h)
- Consider upgrading to a paid plan for higher limits

### "Model mapped to wrong Ollama name"
- Check your mapping file (if used)
- Enable debug logging: `ROUTER_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` to see mapping attempts
- Add explicit mapping entry for the problematic model

## Advanced: Direct Database Queries

You can query benchmark data directly to see which sources contributed:

```sql
-- See all benchmarks for a model
SELECT * FROM model_benchmarks WHERE ollama_name = 'llama3:70b';

-- Check which sources have data (implicit from which fields are non-NULL)
SELECT 
  ollama_name,
  mmlu IS NOT NULL AS has_huggingface,
  elo_rating IS NOT NULL AS has_lmsys,
  extra_data IS NOT NULL AS has_artificial_analysis,
  throughput IS NOT NULL AS has_speed_data
FROM model_benchmarks;
```

The `extra_data` JSON column contains all ArtificialAnalysis-specific fields that don't fit the standard schema.

## Performance Impact

Benchmark sync runs:
- On router startup (if database is empty or `force=true`)
- Periodically via the polling interval (controlled separately)
- When manually triggered via `/admin/reprofile`

Each source typically adds <1 second to startup (cached). Full resync from all sources takes 2-5 seconds. ArtificialAnalysis may take longer due to API rate limiting.

**Tip:** The first sync after enabling a new source may take longer as it fetches all available models. Subsequent syncs are incremental (only new/updated models).

## provider.db Offline Benchmark Database

In addition to live online APIs, SmarterRouter integrates an offline benchmark database `data/provider.db`.

### Key Features
- Pre-compiled scores for **400+ models** across **28+ benchmark datasets** (including Chatbot Arena ELO, MMLU, HumanEval, GPQA, Math-500).
- Auto-downloaded and synchronized in the background every 4 hours (`ROUTER_PROVIDER_DB_AUTO_UPDATE_HOURS=4`).
- Provides instant benchmark lookups for cloud models (`openai/*`, `anthropic/*`, `google/*`, `cohere/*`, `mistral/*`) without requiring third-party API keys.
- **Graceful Fallback:** If the database file is temporarily unavailable or locked during an update, the router continues routing using in-memory cached scores without service interruption.

## Academic Evaluation Suite (`benchmark.py`)

SmarterRouter includes a standalone academic benchmark script in the repository root: `benchmark.py`.

### Measured Metrics
1. **Token Savings Percentage**: Compares prompt tokens before and after pre-flight compression.
2. **Time-To-First-Token (TTFT)**: Measures reduction in GPU prefill latency.
3. **End-to-End Processing Latency**: Measures turn completion time.
4. **Peak GPU VRAM Footprint**: Monitors memory delta via pyNVML / nvidia-smi.
5. **Functional Correctness (Pass@1)**: Validates that compressed prompts retain full answer correctness.

### Running the Evaluation
```bash
# Ensure SmarterRouter is running on port 11436
python benchmark.py --url http://localhost:11436 --iterations 3
```

## Future Sources

We're evaluating additional benchmark sources:
- **OpenCompass** - Comprehensive Chinese/English leaderboard
- **MT-Bench** - Multi-turn conversation benchmarks
- **Custom internal benchmarks** - Enterprise users may want to add proprietary evaluations

The architecture allows easy addition of new `BenchmarkProvider` implementations. If you have a source you'd like to see supported, [open an issue](https://github.com/peva3/SmarterRouter/issues).
